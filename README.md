# drawing machine - cloud!

do imaginative drawing on the cloud!

I often look up at the sky on the bus and enjoy finding the clouds' interesting shapes. Then, I start abstractly or certainly drawing on that cloud. For example, if there was a dragon-like shape of a cloud at home, and in my mind, I draw funny faces or angry facial expressions of dragons. When I learned about drawing machines that allow the user to draw on the image, I thought of my favorite activity on the bus: drawing on the cloud.
